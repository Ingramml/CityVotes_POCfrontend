## Score Breakdown

| # | Dimension | Score | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Prompt Clarity | 4/5 | Clear requests like "review template folder ensure all instructions present to build and deploy on Vercel". Minor ambiguity on initial glossary request. |
| 2 | Goal Definition | 3/5 | Goals emerged organically through the session (glossary → full audit → template kit) rather than being stated upfront. No session-goals.md set at start. |
| 3 | Context Provision | 4/5 | Good use of @file references to point Claude at specific files. Session continuation provided context from prior work. |
| 4 | Scope Management | 4/5 | Tasks were well-scoped and progressive (glossary → ReadMe → audit → fixes). Each request built on the previous. |
| 5 | Iteration Quality | 5/5 | Excellent feedback: quick redirect on filename ("Don't title Readme.md. title Template_ReadMe.md"), clear course corrections, let Claude run when on track. |
| 6 | Tool Leverage | 4/5 | Good use of parallel background agents for audits and file creation. Could have used plan mode for the overall template kit architecture. |
| 7 | Workflow Discipline | 3/5 | No opening workflow used. Session goals not set at start. Closing workflow invoked at end. Partial workflow adoption. |
| 8 | Outcome Achievement | 5/5 | All goals fully achieved: 18-file template kit complete, verified with zero city-specific references, comprehensive documentation. |
| 9 | Knowledge Capture | 4/5 | Excellent documentation created (BUILD_GUIDE.md, Template_ReadMe.md, WIREFRAMES.md glossary). Context.md updated. Session archived. MEMORY.md not updated. |
| 10 | Efficiency | 4/5 | Good use of parallel agents. Session spanned two context windows but produced substantial output. Minor duplication in audit work. |

**Total: 40/50**

## Top Strengths

1. **Iteration Quality (5/5):** Quick, specific feedback that kept work on track. The filename redirect ("Template_ReadMe.md not README.md") was immediate and clear, preventing wasted effort.

2. **Outcome Achievement (5/5):** Every goal was fully completed. The template kit is comprehensive and verified — ready for immediate use.

3. **Progressive Scope Building:** Requests naturally built on each other (glossary → full docs → complete audit → gap fixes), creating a coherent deliverable without scope creep.

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Goal Definition (3/5):** The session would have benefited from stating the end goal upfront: "I want a complete template kit to replicate CityVotes for any city." Instead, goals emerged incrementally. This worked out fine but risked unfocused effort.
   - **Tip:** Start next session with: "Today I want to accomplish X. Here's my priority order: 1, 2, 3."

2. **Workflow Discipline (3/5):** No opening workflow was used and session goals weren't set at start. The closing workflow was invoked, which is good, but the full workflow cycle wasn't followed.
   - **Tip:** Use `/open` at session start to set goals and establish context. This creates better tracking and lets Claude plan its approach.

3. **Knowledge Capture (4/5):** Great project documentation was created, but MEMORY.md wasn't updated with patterns discovered during this session (e.g., template architecture patterns, CSS custom property approach).
   - **Tip:** Ask Claude to "update MEMORY.md" with key patterns at session end, or let the closing workflow handle it.

## Specific Tips for Next Session

1. **Start with goals:** "Today I want to: (1) commit the template folder, (2) generate a Long Beach site using the template."
2. **Use opening workflow:** `/open` sets up session goals and loads context automatically.
3. **Consider plan mode:** For the next city build, use plan mode to validate the data generation approach before starting.
